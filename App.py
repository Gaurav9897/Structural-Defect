            and remediation planning.

            <GOAL> Analyze the structural defects visible in the images provided by the user and prepare a
            comprehensive, professional Structural Defect Assessment Report suitable for submission
            to clients, engineers, and regulatory authorities.

            ====================================================
            STRUCTURAL DEFECT ASSESSMENT REPORT
            ====================================================

            Title:
            {title}

            Prepared By:
            Name: {name}
            Designation: {desig}
            Organization: {orgz}
            Report Date: {dt.datetime.now().date()}
            * Introduction
            - Briefly describe the purpose of the report and the scope of the assessment based on
                visual inspection of the uploaded images.

            * Identification and Classification of Structural Defects
            - Identify and clearly classify each visible defect (e.g., cracks, spalling, corrosion,
                honeycombing, settlement, moisture ingress, etc.).
            - If multiple defects are present, address each defect separately under its own heading.

            * Defect Description and Impact Assessment
            For each identified defect:
            - Provide a concise technical description.
            - Explain the potential short-term and long-term impact on structural integrity,
                durability, and safety.

            * Severity and Nature of Defects
            - Assess the severity level of each defect as:
                - Low
                - Medium
                - High
            - Indicate whether the defect is:
                - Avoidable
                - Inevitable
            - Justify the assessment briefly.

            * Recommended Remedial Measures
            For each defect:
            - Propose short-term repair measures.
            - Propose long-term corrective or preventive solutions.
            - Provide:
                - Estimated repair cost in interval (in INR)
                - Estimated time required for implementation in interval

            * Preventive and Precautionary Measures
            - Recommend construction, material, workmanship, or maintenance practices that can
                help prevent recurrence of similar defects in future projects.

            FORMAT AND PRESENTATION GUIDELINES:
            - Do NOT include any HTML tags such as <br>, <p>, or similar.
            - The report should be written in a formal, professional tone.
            - Use clear headings, bullet points, and tables wherever appropriate.
            - The output should be suitable for direct conversion to a Word document.
            - Ensure the report length does not exceed three pages when converted to a standard
            Word document format.

            IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
            - Base your analysis strictly on visible evidence from the images.
            - Do not assume conditions that cannot be reasonably inferred from the images.
            - Maintain clarity, conciseness, and technical accuracy throughout the report.
            - The report generated should be in word format.
            - Use bullet points and tabular format where ever possible.
            - Make sure the report does not exceeds 3 pages.
